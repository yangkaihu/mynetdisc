# FFmpeg

 According to the description one the official website:
 
FFMPEG stands for Fast Forward Moving Picture Experts Group. It is a free and open source software project that offers many tools for video and audio processing. It's designed to run on a command line interface, and has many different libraries and programs to manipulate and handle video files. However, FFMPEG is available for use in many different programming languages. With FFMPEG, you can decode, encode, transcode, mux, demux, stream, filter and play most types of video and audio. A fun fact about the FFMPEG logo is that it is based on the zigzag scan used in entropy encoding for images and video.

Yeah,in my opinion ,it is a set of open source computer programs that can be used to record,convert digital audio and video ,and convert them into streams.Open the link to download please : https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
